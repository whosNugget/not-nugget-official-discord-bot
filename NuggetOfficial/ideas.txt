Sharding and Data Storage
	If the bot is ever to be publicied (unlikely) it will need to be sharded but it also needs to have a more dynamic way of storing data

Launcher/GUI
	It would be a very fun experiement/challenge to "wrap" the bot in a GUI or launcher where you can enable/disable modules and set the bot settings, while also dynamically enabling and disabling the bot
	The GUI should inform the user if the bot is running and what settings it is using
	The bot should remain active (maybe through a service) even when the launcher/GUI is exited
	Perhaps look into some system tray features OR system services to get this running in the background
