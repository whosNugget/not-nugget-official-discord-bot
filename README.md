# not-nugget-official-bot
 My personal bot project repo. Any idea for bots or automations that could make my internet life easier will go into this repository, likely as its own project.
 
 Currently my most developed endeavor is a Discord bot that is built on the DSharpPlus framework.
 
 I one day plan to develop many different programs and bots that do many different things, ranging from sending tweets, to changing profile pictures, to having a launcher program that allows me to selectively enable and disable bots, programs and features. 
 
 Basically, if a project would require the use of an external API, it will more than likely be put in here. Unless its big enough for its own repository
